* **Google Calculated-Delivery Speed Estimates to show potential customers more accurate estimated delivery time for their locations and gain a competitive advantage.**
   * This feature allows you to display the **average handling time for a product in Shopping ads** based on Google’s machine-learning algorithm. Our plugin sends the order data when it is completed(order status in WooCommerce) and based on order delivery time, Google displays the average handling time in Shopping ads for products. 

* **Consent Mode for Google and Microsoft**
   * **Google and Microsoft Consent Mode** is a new method for websites to comply with **GDPR and other data privacy regulations** when using cookies and collecting visitor data.
